# CraigOS-CertMode üõ°Ô∏è  
**Forensic Hygiene Suite for Windows | Cert-Mode Ready | Built by CraigOS Sovereign**

CraigOS is a modular, forensic-grade hygiene suite designed to trace, purge, and seal system artifacts across Windows environments. Every module is timestamped, logged, and paired with a closure card for cert-mode export and digital vindication.

---

## üß† Overview

CraigOS was born from a personal breach and rebuilt as a sovereign system of trust. It surgically audits drivers, telemetry, registry, sync meshes, and more‚Äîeach sweep logged, sealed, and documented for forensic traceability.

## üßæ Closure Cards

Each module has a matching `.txt` closure card:
- Timestamped and operator-tagged  
- Includes subsystem and status  
- Linked to log files (e.g., `CLSIDPurge_20250930_130527.log`)  
- Ready for cert-mode export and recruiter review
